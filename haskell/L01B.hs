-- As you can define a function in term of itself, similarly,
-- you can define a custom datatype in term of itself too

-- Remember, Add ... returns a Hand. It's a ctor of

-- handBeats: does one hand beat a given card

-- Given Empty (i.e. Hand datatype with no card) and a Card 'c',
-- who will win?

-- `<function>` is called infix form. It is a syntactic sugar
-- similar to cardBeats (card1) (card2).
-- TODO: h `handBeats` c -- recursion blackmagic
handBeats (Add c' h) c = c' `cardBeats` c || h `handBeats` c

-- example: size of a hand
size :: Hand -> Int
size Empty     = 0
size (Add c h) = 1 + size h

-- calculate length of array recursively
length' []     = 0
length' (x:xs) = 1 + length' xs


--- This example is discussed in

splitHand :: Hand -> (Hand,Hand)
  -- split a deck into the Red and the Black cards

-- Three methods
-- 1. Simple double traversal
splitHand h = (select Red h, select Black h)

select :: Colour -> Hand -> Hand
select col Empty     = Empty
select col (Add c h) | col == colourCard c = Add c (select col h)
                     | otherwise           = select col h
                    
-- TODO: wth is this blackmagic -___-
-- 2. Direct recursive definition
splitHand' Empty     = (Empty, Empty)
splitHand' (Add c h)
     | colourCard c == Red = (Add c reds, blacks)
     | otherwise           = (reds, Add c blacks)
    where (reds, blacks) = splitHand' h
    
-- David: this definition is closest to what a human
--        will do to sort a deck of cards
-- In the beginning, you have a deck of cards 'h'
-- with both blacks and reds deck as Empty. And then,
-- we will slowly accumulate the reds and blacks until
-- 'h' is Empty
-- Consider Python:
{-
    for card in cards:
      if (card.color == "Black"):
        blacks.add(card)
      else
        reds.add(card)
-}
-- 3. Single recursion using a helper function
--   (using accumulating parameters)

splitHand'' h = split h Empty Empty
--      base case or leaf node of the recursion
  where split Empty     reds blacks = (reds, blacks)
        split (Add c h) reds blacks
          | colourCard c == Red = split h (Add c reds) blacks
          | otherwise           = split h reds         (Add c blacks)


-- Further example ----------

-- See video lecture: https://youtu.be/-L18-DK5y3U?t=1031

-- chooseCard beat hand 
-- chooses a card from hand to play, 
-- when beat is the card to be beaten
   -- If the hand is only one card, play it
   -- If there is a choice,
   --    Select the best card from the rest of the hand
   --    Choose between it and the first card
   -- Principles
   --   1. Follow suit if possible 
   -- (like in "trick winning" games: whist, bridge, ...)
   --   2. Play lowest winning card if possible
   --   3. Play lowest losing card otherwise

-- 
{- 
chooseCard :: Card -> Hand -> Card
chooseCard b (Add c Empty) = c
chooseCard b (Add c h) 
 | tnt c  c' = c
 | tnt c' c  = c'
 | otherwise = rankMin c c'
    where c'        = chooseCard b h
          -- is first card trumps and second non-trumps?
          tnt c1 c2 = suit c1 == suit b 
                    && not (suit c2 == suit b)

rankMin c c' | rank c < rank c' = c 
             | otherwise        = c'
